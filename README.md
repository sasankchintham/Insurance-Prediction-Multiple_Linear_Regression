Insurance Charge Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression
**Project Overview**:

This project aims to predict insurance charges based on customer data, such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. The focus was on handling dataset challenges, including non-linear relationships, outliers, and categorical variables, to build a robust predictive model using Multiple Linear Regression.

**Problem Statement**:
The dataset presented challenges like non-linear relationships among features, outliers in numerical variables (bmi, charges), and categorical data (sex, smoker, region) that required effective preprocessing to enhance prediction accuracy.

**Actions Taken**:

**Preprocessing**: Capped outliers and encoded categorical variables using numeric replacements and one-hot encoding.
**Feature Engineering**: Introduced polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships.
**Model Development**: Implemented a Multiple Linear Regression model and evaluated its performance.

**Results**:
Achieved an accuracy of 86.77% after preprocessing and feature engineering.
The model demonstrated a significant improvement in performance and successfully captured non-linear patterns in the data.

**Key Learnings**:

Importance of handling outliers and encoding categorical variables effectively.
Utilizing polynomial features to address non-linear relationships in predictive modeling.

**Technologies Used**:
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
